Author's description:

Animated 3D rotating metallic objects.

Got them uploaded here some time ago, but with a few pieces missing (for some reason in all packs I found this cursor set was incomplete, now with "busy" and "alternate"). This cursor set is very old and probably does not have "location" and "person" type cursors.

Search words: volumetric, pyramid, metal.
